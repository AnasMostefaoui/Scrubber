# Playground Animation Scrubber ðŸŽš

There are a lot of frameworks and tools for making animations and animated
transitions for your iOS projects.

If you're targeting iOS/tvOS 10.0+, then `UIViewPropertyAnimator` is probably
powerful enough for your needs: It includes the standard easing curves, a nice
implementation of spring physics, an easy way to define your own custom
timing curve, and a scalable API that allows from simple single step
interpolation, to chained, interruptible, and animations that can be modified on
the fly.

## ScrubContainerView
This project doesn't modify or build on top of `UIViewPropertyAnimator`, but
instead provides `ScrubContainerView` â€” a simple UIView subclass â€” that makes it
easier to create, explore, debug, and refine an animation in a playground.


Start by making a playground and importing `UIKit` and `PlaygroundSupport`

````Swift
import UIKit
import PlaygroundSupport
````

Create a new `ScrubContainerView` and make that the playground's `liveView`
(this presents the view in the playground's assistant editor panel.

````Swift
let container = ScrubContainerView()
PlaygroundPage.current.liveView = container
````

Next, go ahead an set up the objects to be animated, adding them to the
`ScrubContainerView` and setting their initial positions.

````Swift
let square = UIView()
container.addSubview(square)
square.center = container.center
square.transform = .identity
square.bounds.size = CGSize(width: 150, height: 50)
square.backgroundColor = .red
````

Finally, assign `animator` with a closure that returns a
`UIViewPropertyAnimator`. This defines the animations to perform.

````Swift
container.animator = {

    // create the animator with the duration and timing curve
    // (in this case using a spring-physics)
    let animator = UIViewPropertyAnimator(duration: 2.0, dampingRatio: 0.5)

    // define the properties to animate
    animator.addAnimations {
        square.transform = CGAffineTransform(rotationAngle: CGFloat.pi/2)
        square.bounds.size = CGSize(width: 50, height: 150)
        square.backgroundColor = .blue
    }
    // return the animator
    return animator
}
````

`ScrubContainerView` adds a `UISlider` that lets you scrub through the animation
and look at it at any intermediate step.

If you wrap the expressions that define the default set-up of the animation into
the `startState` closure,`ScrubContainerView` will add a button button that lets
you to watch the animation perform with it's defined duration and timing curve.

````Swift
container.startState = {
    square.transform = .identity
    square.bounds.size = CGSize(width: 150, height: 50)
    square.backgroundColor = .red
}
````

The playground includes this simple example, as well as a [slightly more complex
example](https://github.com/mathewsanders/Scrubber/blob/master/source/Animation.playground/Pages/Keyframe%20example.xcplaygroundpage/Contents.swift)
that includes a 4-step animation chained together using keyframes to show how
more complex multi-step animations can be built.

## Roadmap
- [x] UISlider to scrub animations
- [x] Button to play animation with default timing curve and duration
- [ ] Initializers for different device sizes
- [ ] Resume animation after scrubbing
- [ ] Pause/resume animation
- [ ] Scrub paused animation

## Requirements

- Swift 3.0
- iOS/tvOS 10.0+
